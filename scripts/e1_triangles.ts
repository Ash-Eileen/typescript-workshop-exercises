/**
 * Exercise 1
 *
 * Below is an array of triangles, defined by the length of each side.
 *
 * Update the script function to iterate through each one and determine
 * what kind of triangle it is:
 *   - scalene (all sides different)
 *   - isoceles (two sides the same)
 *   - equilateral (all sides the same)
 *
 * Start by defining a 'Triangle' interface with each of the side attributes,
 * then use this type when working with the triangles.
 *
 * Once you have finished, check for any linting issues by running 'npm run lint'.
 *
